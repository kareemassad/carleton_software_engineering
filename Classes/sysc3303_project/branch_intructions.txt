To start working on each iteration's code a separate branch should be created
first as follows:

1. Make sure that working directory is clean by "git status"
2. Makesure that you are at master branch by "git branch"
3. Switch to master branch (if not there) "git checkout master", then do "git pull origin master" to
make sure you have most recent version.
4. When in master branch do "git checkout -b i#_xxx"  where # - iteration
number, and xxxx is you name in small letters. For example: i1_igor  dont use capital letters
5. that is it, do git branch to make sure you are in the corect branch.

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS ALWAYS do "git status" before you start anything with git
to figure out the state of your working directory. IT IS A MUST AND VERY
IMPORTANT

feel free to improve this instraction and make corretions 

Instructions needed: please write here, what other instructions you guys would
like to have.

- How do we push the code to the repo after we're done with it?
- After your commit/commits are done you again check the condition of the
  working directory with "git status" 
 if everything is okay you do "git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_name"

One very useful git command is "git log"   (press q to escape)
it shows you all previous commits.

NOTICE:
if you have occasionally commited into master instead of your branch due to
non-switching you shoudl do the following.

(!!!) Than will work only if you have not pushed into master.

1. do "git reset HEAD~"  that will roll back to the state before your last commit
2. then switch to your branch "git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH"
3. Do you commmit and push procedures

Always do your "git status" to figure our where you are and what changes you
are adding.

Always add on per file basis i.e.  "git add FILE_NAME"
